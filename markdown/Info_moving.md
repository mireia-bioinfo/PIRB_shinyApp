Moving around
================

It is possible to change the coordinates of the plot by moving the circles in the slider above the plot to the desired coordinates. Each slider can be moved separately by clicking on each independent circle or together by clicking in the bar joining the two circles.

Alternatively new coordinates can be entered in the _Input Region_ section in the sidebar at the left of the plot. 

The __submit__ button will allow to refresh the plot to the desired new coordinates.
