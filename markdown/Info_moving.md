Moving around
================

It is possible to change the coordinates of the plot by moving left or right to the desired coordinates, the circles above the plot. Alternatively new coordinates can be entered in the *Input Region* section at the left of the plot. The submit button will allow to refresh the plot to the desired new coordinates.
