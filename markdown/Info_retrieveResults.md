=====================

Graphical representations and text tables are available for download.

The plot can be downloaded as PDF (Adobe Portable Document) format by clicking on the download icon above the plot.

A button above the plot provides a link to a UCSC browser session containing all the data currently available in the Islet Regulome Browser for classic UCSC visualization. For this purpose bigwig files were generated by aligning unique reads from the [raw data](http://gattaca.imppc.org/isletregulome/data) using Bowtie2 (default parameters). For transcription factor binding sites and chromatin maps refer to the parameters used in [the original publications](http://gattaca.imppc.org/isletregulome/data).

Two tables related to the selected locus can be downloaded from the "Table" panel, selectable from the top left corner of the plot page. One table contains the regulatory regions, open chromatin classes or chromatin states selected for display along with the transcription factors who's bind sites overlap them. The other table contains a list of the variants contained in the selected locus along with their p-value of association.
