Generate a plot
==========================


A plot can be generated by selecting a valid _gene name_ or an absolute _chromosomal location_ by specifying the genomic coordinates (chromosome, start, and end) in the human build hg19. The plot can be extended on both sides by selecting a 0, 1Kb, 5Kb, 10Kb, 50Kb (default), 100Kb, 500Kb, 1Mb range.

From the _Features_ panel 4 major track types can be loaded to obtain the desired plot.

1. Tracks called **Chromatin maps** and **Enhancer clustering annotations** refer to genomic maps of regions that may be involved in gene transcription regulation. Such maps were inferred from experimental data sets such as open chromatin and histone modification profiles obtained from adult human pancreatic islets and pancreatic progenitors cell types.
2. **Transcription factors** tracks are maps of transcription factors binding sites obtained from Chip-seq experiments performed in human adult pancreatic islets and pancreatic progenitors.
3. **SNPs** tracks include GWAS variants datasets associated to type 2 diabetes and fasting glycemia.
4. The **Virtual 4C** track enables to visualize promoter capture HiC data performed in human pancreatic islets in a virtual 4C format, in which the queried region (scrooll down menu) is used as the bait or viewpoint.

After changing any of the desired _Features_ of _Coordinates_ you should click on the __Submit__ button to start the generation of the plot.
